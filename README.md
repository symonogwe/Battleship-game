# Battleships Game
Welcome to the Battleships Game repository! This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Battleships game, where players strategically place ships on a grid and take turns trying to sink each other's fleet.

## Features
- Player vs. Computer: Engage in an exciting one-on-one battle against the computer.
- Ship Placement: Strategically place your ships on the game grid before the battle begins.
- Turn-based Gameplay: Take turns firing shots at your opponent's grid to locate and destroy their ships.
- Win Condition: The first player to destroy all of their opponent's ships wins the game.
## Technologies Used

- JavaScript: The game logic and functionality are implemented using JavaScript.
- HTML/CSS: The user interface is built using HTML for structure and CSS for styling.
- Object Oriented Programming (OOP): The game is implemented using OOP principles to organize code into reusable and maintainable classes and objects.
- Jest: Unit testing is implemented using the Jest testing framework to ensure the reliability and correctness of the codebase.

## How to Play
- Setup: Start by placing your ships on the grid. Click on the grid cells to position your ships vertically or horizontally.
- Gameplay: Take turns firing shots at your opponent's grid by clicking on their grid cells. The game will indicate whether your shot was a hit or a miss.
- Winning: Continue firing shots until you have successfully destroyed all of your opponent's ships. The first player to achieve this wins the game.

  ## Testing
- Unit tests are implemented using the Jest testing framework. To run the tests, follow these steps:
- npm install
- npm test
